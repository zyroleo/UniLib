## 📖 OVERVIEW

UniLib’s library-system-DB module provides the database schema and scripts for a Library Management System.

It is intended to support key library operations storing book and member records, tracking borrow/return transactions, and managing library data in a relational database.

This module focuses solely on database design and data management (tables, relationships, data constraints) rather than UI or application logic.<br/>

## 🚀 FEATURES

#### 🔹 Core Database Features

- 📘 Book catalog (title, author, availability, category)<br/>

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Member records<br/>

- 🔄 Loan management (borrow/return)<br/>

- 🗂 Categories & metadata<br/>

#### 🔹 Technical Features

-   🔐 Foreign keys & constraints<br/>

- 🧱 Normalized and clean schema<br/>

- ⚙️ Optional triggers & views<br/>

- 📦 Easy export/import<br/>

## 🦋OOP Concepts Applied
#### 🔹 Encapsulation

All class fields are protected/private and accessed through getters and setters to preserve data integrity.

#### 🔹 Inheritance

Common attributes `(e.g., ID, name, contact info)` are placed in base classes, which are extended by more specific classes such as `Student, Faculty, etc.`

#### 🔹 Polymorphism

Key operations `(e.g., displaying information, validating records)` are overridden across subclasses to allow dynamic behavior.

#### 🔹 Abstraction

Core functionalities `(e.g., item registration, borrowing process)` are placed in abstract or general classes to hide implementation details from users.

├── Database.java           # Handles database connections + queries

### Main Components:

**Book 📚** – represents items in the library

**Member 🪪** – base class for library users

**Student / Faculty 👥** – subclasses with specific rules

**Transaction 🖥️** – handles borrowing + returning

**Database 📊** – mock or real DB storage

**MainMenu 💻** – entry point and user interface

**Relationships (simplified):**
Member
 ├── Student
 └── Faculty
*Book  ←→  Transaction  ←→  Member*

## 🧋How to Run the Program
✔ Compile 🤖
-       javac MainMenu.java
✔ Run 🤖
-       java MainMenu

If the project uses packages, run:
```
javac -d . */*.java
java ui.MainMenu
```
If using a database, ensure the DB file or connection settings are correct before running.

=============================
[1] Add Book
[2] Register Member
[3] Borrow Book
[4] Return Book
[5] View Records
[0] Exit
Choose an option: 1

Another example:
Book borrowed successfully!
